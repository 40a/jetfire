= jetfire

An Ansible inventory tool.

== Overview
Jetfire is a web based Flask application with a MongoDB backend to manage an Ansible inventory.

It is currently in early stage and lacks fearures and proper documentation. It currently has the following features :

* add host with vars and add it to available groups
* add groups with vars and available members
* get host info (hostvars)
* get group info (groupvars and members)
* edit host vars and groups
* edit groups vars and hosts

== Usage

You'll need a running MongoDB instance and create a DB that you will use for your inventory.

clone the repository and edit the config.cfg file in the +app+ folder (specify mongodb server, port and database). Then run python app.py to launch the application.
Open a browser and point to http://<yourhost>:5000

== TODO
* list required Python packages
* add and edit children of a group
* enable versioning in MongoDB
