= jetfire

An Ansible inventory tool based on LDAP

== Overview
Jetfire is a web based Flask application with an LDAP backend to manage an Ansible inventory.
It works in conjunction with the [ldap inventory script](https://github.com/vincentvdk/ansible_inventory.git)

It is currently in early stage and lacks fearures and proper documentation. It can currently do the following

* add host with vars and add it to available groups
* add groups with vars and available members
* get host info (hostvars)
* get group info (groupvars and members)

== Usage

You need a working LDAP server that has the ansible schema loaded. Check the  [ldap inventory script](https://github.com/vincentvdk/ansible_inventory.git) repository for more info on this.

clone the repository and edit the config.cfg file in the app folder. Then run python app.py to launch the application.
